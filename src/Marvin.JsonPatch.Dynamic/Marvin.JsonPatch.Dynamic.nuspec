    <description>Marvin.JsonPatch.Dynamic adds support for dynamically typed objects to Marvin.JsonPatch.

Marvin.JsonPatch was built to work on staticly typed objects, which is great for most cases. Yet sometimes you'll want to create a patch document without having a static type to start from (for example: when integrating with a backend that's out of your control), or you'll want to apply a JsonPatchDocument to a dynamic object, or an object that has a property which isn't statically typed.

That's what this component takes care of. It extends Marvin.JsonPatch with new methods on JsonPatchDocument, and it allows you to apply the JsonPatchDocument to dynamically typed objects.</description>
